# Delhi Air Quality Advisor — Reference Guide

This document provides structured, non-medical information about typical air quality patterns across Delhi. It includes area-wise AQI behavior, seasonal trends, general safety practices, and a directory of major medical facilities. The goal is to offer clear, neutral, and practical guidance for everyday decision-making.


## Disclaimer
This guide provides general, non-medical information based on typical environmental patterns and publicly available knowledge. It does not offer medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations. For health-related concerns, please consult a qualified professional.

## How to Use This Guide

- Use the area-wise AQI patterns to understand typical air quality behavior in different parts of Delhi.
- Refer to seasonal trends to anticipate broad changes throughout the year.
- Follow the general safety guidance for practical, non-medical steps during high pollution periods.
- Check the medical facilities section for quick reference to major hospitals across the city.
- Combine these sections to make informed, everyday decisions about outdoor activities and travel.

## 1. Area-wise Typical AQI Patterns

### North Delhi
- Typical AQI range: Often falls in the 180–260 range on average days, with higher values during winter months.
- Notes: Areas like Wazirabad, Jahangirpuri, and Burari tend to experience elevated particulate levels due to traffic density, industrial clusters, and lower wind dispersion.

### South Delhi
- Typical AQI range: Commonly ranges between 150–230 on most days, with relatively better dispersion compared to northern and eastern zones.
- Notes: Areas like Saket, Hauz Khas, and Greater Kailash often show slightly lower particulate levels due to more green cover and wider road layouts, though traffic congestion can still cause spikes.

### East Delhi
- Typical AQI range: Frequently falls in the 180–280 range, with higher particulate accumulation due to dense residential clusters and proximity to major traffic corridors.
- Notes: Localities such as Mayur Vihar, Laxmi Nagar, and Anand Vihar often experience elevated AQI because of heavy vehicular movement and limited wind flow.

### West Delhi
- Typical AQI range: Generally ranges between 170–250, with variations depending on traffic and construction activity.
- Notes: Areas like Punjabi Bagh, Janakpuri, and Rajouri Garden may see spikes during peak hours due to commercial activity and road congestion.

### Central Delhi
- Typical AQI range: Often lies between 160–240, influenced by administrative zones, commercial hubs, and continuous traffic.
- Notes: Connaught Place, Karol Bagh, and nearby regions may show fluctuations based on traffic density and ongoing infrastructure work.

### Known Pollution Hotspots
- Areas: Anand Vihar, Jahangirpuri, Wazirpur, Mundka, RK Puram (sector-specific), and certain industrial pockets.
- Why they tend to spike: High traffic volume, industrial clusters, waste processing zones, and lower wind dispersion contribute to elevated particulate levels.

## 2. Seasonal Pollution Trends

- **October–November:** Air quality typically worsens due to a combination of weather inversion, reduced wind speeds, and particulate accumulation from surrounding regions.
- **December–January:** Cold temperatures and low wind movement trap pollutants near the surface, leading to persistent smog and poor dispersion.
- **February–March:** Gradual improvement as temperatures rise and wind speeds increase, helping disperse accumulated pollutants.
- **April–June:** AQI often improves overall, though dust levels may rise due to dry conditions and ongoing construction activity.
- **July–September:** Rainfall significantly improves air quality by washing out suspended particulate matter.

## 3. General Safety Guidance (Non-medical)

- Prefer using N95 or KN95 masks on days with elevated particulate levels.
- Avoid outdoor exercise during high pollution periods, especially early mornings and late evenings.
- Keep windows closed when AQI is poor to limit indoor particulate entry.
- Use air purifiers where available, especially in enclosed spaces.
- Stay hydrated and take regular breaks if spending extended time outdoors.
- Check air quality forecasts before planning outdoor activities.
- Prefer indoor ventilation with filtered air rather than open windows during poor AQI days.
- Choose routes with lower traffic density when walking or commuting.

## 5. Local Tips & Notes

- Early mornings and late evenings often see higher particulate levels due to temperature inversion.
- Traffic-heavy corridors can show short-term spikes even when overall AQI is moderate.
- Parks and green belts may offer slightly better air quality compared to dense commercial zones.
- Construction activity can cause localized dust increases, especially in rapidly developing areas.
- AQI can vary significantly within short distances depending on road congestion and wind flow.



## Limitations

- This guide does not provide real-time AQI data.
- Area-wise ranges represent typical patterns and may vary based on weather and local conditions.
- The information is intended for general awareness and not for medical or emergency decision-making.
- Pollution levels can change rapidly due to environmental or human factors.

## Sources & Methodology

This guide is based on publicly available environmental information, long-term air quality patterns, and general knowledge about Delhi’s geography and seasonal behavior. No real-time data or medical guidance is included.


## Glossary

- **AQI (Air Quality Index):** A numerical scale used to communicate how polluted the air is.
- **PM2.5:** Fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, often used as a key indicator of air quality.
- **PM10:** Particulate matter up to 10 micrometers in size.
- **Inversion:** A weather condition where warm air traps cooler air near the ground, reducing pollutant dispersion.
- **Dispersion:** The natural spreading of pollutants in the air due to wind and atmospheric movement.
